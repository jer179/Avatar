                  switches to a closer shot of the skeleton in the snow and slowly zooms in on it. The
                  skeleton is adorned with a round necklace that supports the symbol of airbending.

                  up; Sokka retracts his hands and gasps for air in fright. Switch to an overview shot
                  of inside the sanctuary where Katara is walking down the circular pattern of statues.
                  She stops before and looks at the statue of Avatar Roku. Cut to a close-up of the

                  suddenly looks surprised as a bluish, white light illuminates her face; it seems to
                  come from the statue. Cut back to a close-up of the statue. Its eyes are gleaming
                  bright. The bright light spreads to the other statues and one by one, their eyes start
                  to gleam. The camera pans up to reveal how the light travels from statue to statue
                  and makes its way up to the top of the sanctuary. The camera's point of view switches
                  again to behind Roku's shoulder to show Katara, who is still staring at Roku in shock.</i></b>

                  as he prepares to face the incoming, burning projectiles. He ducks underneath
                  the first and uses his staff to decimate the next fire ball. He rapidly spins
                  the staff over his head, propelling himself in the air. He lands in front of
                  Zuko, who immediately kicks the staff out of his hands. Aang jumps up and lands
                  between two fans of a Kyoshi Warrior that are lying on the ground. He stands up
                  and picks us the fan with his airbending. Close-up of Zuko, who madly charges
                  Aang with his fist already held stretched out before him. Aang spins around a
                  few times to create a bigger momentum and uses the extra power of his swirl to
                  blast Zuko in a nearby house with a strong blast of air. Aang looks sad and
                  lowers the fans. He runs down the main street and picks up his staff along the
                  way. Aang tosses the object in the air, where it snaps open into his glider and
                  jumps on. A close-up of a saddened Aang, switches to the scene he is seeing: a
                  lot of burning houses and the Fire Nation troops among them. Aang looks back to
                  see the burning statue of Avatar Kyoshi, which saddens Aang even more.</i></b>

               best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we
