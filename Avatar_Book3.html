                  </span>	Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot
               in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through
               all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow
               my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something
               you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play
               my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to
               the world. <b><i>[To Toph.]</i></b> I'm sorry for what I did to you. <b><i>[Bows to her.]</i></b> It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to
               be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.</p>
            
            <p><span class="Other">Aang:
                  </span>	<b><i>[Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a moment.]</i></b> I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn
               firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand
               how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. <b><i>[Bows before Zuko.]</i></b></p>

                  </span>	<b><i>[Bows.]</i></b> Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.</p>
            
            <p><span class="Other">Aang:
                  </span>	Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. <b><i>[To Toph.]</i></b> Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?</p>
            
            <p><span class="Other">Toph:
                  </span>	Go ahead and let him join. <b><i>[Pounds her fist into her palm jokingly.]</i></b> It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.</p>
