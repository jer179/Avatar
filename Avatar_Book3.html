               the world. <b><i>[To Toph.]</i></b> I'm sorry for what I did to you. <b><i>[Bows to her.]</i></b> It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to

                  right, and flies above him. Cut to a close-up of Roku from the side, as he looks up
                  toward his dragon. Cut to an aerial view of the debris, rapidly approaching Avatar
                  Roku. With the rock avalanche just moments away from swallowing Roku, Fang flies down,
                  and wraps himself around Roku. The wave of ash and rubble cover the two completely,
