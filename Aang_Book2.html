                  state. His rage subsides to make room for pure, heartbreaking sadness.</i></b>

            <b><i>Aang sees an image of him letting Katara go, and a bridge that will lead him to Avatar

                  Spirit, which is an enlarged image of himself in the Avatar State. The Avatar Spirit
                  is holding a ball of energy, and Aang walks directly inside of it. As he does so,
                  his tatooes glow, and he closes his eyes. Right before he is able to completely open
                  the final chakra and master the Avatar State, however, he hears a shriek from Katara
                  and sees a vision of her in chains. At this, he jumps out of the energy sphere and
                  runs away from the Avatar Spirit. The energy bridge that lead him there slowly vanishes
                  behind him until it catches up and falls from underneath him, causing his image to
                  plummet toward Earth. This cuts his connection to the Avatar State, which forces him
