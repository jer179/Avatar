                  He jumps up and runs away, but turns to look at Zuko, his eyes huge and full of compassion.
                  He sees the Fire Nation soldiers getting close through the smoke. Still, he hesitates.

               the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit
               my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He
               was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like
               you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?</p>

                  and flies away on a current of air. Zuko watches him hop away from tree branch to
                  tree branch and out sight. Cut to Zuko as the camera slowly zooms backward. Zuko raises
