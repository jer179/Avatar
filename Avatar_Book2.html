                  can be seen in the water. Cuts to view of the river bank and the area nearby as Zuko

                  catching their breath.</i></b>

                  who holds the knife under his ponytail. Cuts to close-up of his ponytail, as he slices
                  it off with the knife. He holds it in his hand and looks at it for a moment before
                  passing the knife to Iroh, who cuts off his topknot. Cuts to Zuko's hand, as he releases
                  his ponytail. Cuts to the surface of the river, as the two topknots are released and
                  float down the river. The camera zooms out to where Zuko and Iroh stand quietly on
                  the bank of the river.</i></b></p>

               <b><i>[Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him.]</i></b> I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by.
               <b><i>[Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something
                     back.]</i></b> But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.</p>

            <p><span class="Other">Iroh:
                  </span>	No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road
               and you surrender to your lowest instincts. <b><i>[Zuko bows his head as he listens to his uncle's wisdom.]</i></b> In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of
               inner strength.</p>
            <b><i>Zuko turns to face his uncle, who looks back at him with a sad look upon his face.
                  Abruptly, Zuko pulls free from Iroh's grasp and heads out into the forest.</i></b></p>

            <b><i>The soldier runs forward, spear in hand. He goes to attack Zuko, who pulls out his
                  sword and punches the other man in the stomach with the hilt without fully unsheathing
                  his sword. Zuko re-sheathes his sword while the man slides backward and runs away,
                  panting heavily in fear.
                  A second Earth Kingdom soldier groans and runs to attack Zuko with his spear this
                  time. Zuko punches the spear upward to move it out of the way, grabs onto the man's
                  forehead, and shoves him to the ground. The man gets up slowly and flees as well.
                  
                  A third Earth Kingdom soldier charges toward Zuko with his spear as well. Zuko stands
                  there, waiting, until the spear is close enough and kicks the spear right in the middle,
                  snapping it. The spearhead, along with half of the spear, goes flying in the other
                  direction. The soldier gasps and runs away from Zuko like the two men before him.
                  Lee laughs in satisfaction. A crowd has gathered; Sela's worried face is one of many.
                  
                  With the last of his cronies gone, Gow steps up to the plate to fight Zuko, dual hammers
                  against dual swords. They draw their weapons, and Gow throws the first blow, a rock
                  he has earthbent, and powerfully thrusts over to Zuko. Zuko deflects it readily with
                  his swords. Gow strikes again, this time with three large rocks instead of one. He
                  sends them over in rapid succession to Zuko, who deflects the first two easily. However,
                  the third rock hits him in the stomach and he stumbles backward. This does not dismay
                  him though, so he charges Gow. An old man in the crowd cheers him on.</i></b>

            <b><i>Gow does the same earthbending trick as earlier; he throws three large rocks at Zuko.
                  Zuko responds the same as before, deflecting the first two but the third one hitting
                  him square in the abdomen. However, this time, he falls over and somersaults backward,
                  and manages to get up, although weakened and still stumbling around. Gow smiles.</i></b>

                  </span>	Behind you!</p>
            <b><i>Gow earthbends again, but with increasingly larger rocks each time. He shoots four
                  rocks at Zuko, who manages to destroy each, one by one. It continues this way, Gow
                  no longer giving little recovery breaks to Zuko. Both are fighting at full force,
                  although Zuko is so busy being defensive of the large flying rocks that he cannot
                  become offensive to Gow. However, finally Gow creates a rockalanche and directs it
                  at Zuko. The crowd gasps collectively. Zuko is sent flying and lands straight on his
                  back, and has a sudden flashback.
                  In the flashback, Zuko is sleeping in his room at night when a hand gently touches
                  his shoulder. He awakens drowsily to see his mother dressed in a cloak.</i></b>

               are.</p>
            <b><i>She turns away from him with a sad smile, pulls her hood up and disappears down the
                  dark hallway; it is the flashback Zuko had at the very beginning of the episode.
                  The flashback ends as suddenly as it begin, and we cut back to Zuko in the Earth Kingdom
                  village, lying on the ground. Gow is approaching him.</i></b>

            <b><i>Gow raises his hammers to deliver the final blow when Zuko's eyes open. He reaches
                  for his swords and gets up firebending, creating a hurricane of flame. Gow drops his
                  hammers and is pushed over, and lands on his back. Zuko stands there, seething at
                  Gow. Although unarmed, Gow stands up and raises his fists, determined to finish the
                  fight. Zuko charges him, sending various fire blasts. Gow tries to deflect them with
                  earthbending, but the blasts are too powerful and he is sent backward again. Rocks
                  hit his head as he lands in with a cloud of dust.</i></b>

                  earthbending on the pillar, and Azula gasps once she notices the pillar crumbling.

                  of himself in the Avatar State. Back in the crystal shelter, Aang enters the Avatar State and the crystal shelter starts glowing, alerting those outside. Inside the

                  sincere, sad expression. She pulls him back to the ground and presses him close against
                  her chest. Sokka and Toph lower their arms as the wind becomes less violent. Tears
                  are streaming down the Avatar's glowing eyes. Katara tries her best to hold on as
                  her own tears well up. The air sphere slowly dissolves away as Aang leaves the Avatar
                  state. His rage subsides to make room for pure, heartbreaking sadness.</i></b>
