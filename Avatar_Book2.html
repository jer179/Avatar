                  who holds the knife under his ponytail. Cuts to close-up of his ponytail, as he slices
                  it off with the knife. He holds it in his hand and looks at it for a moment before
                  passing the knife to Iroh, who cuts off his topknot. Cuts to Zuko's hand, as he releases
                  his ponytail. Cuts to the surface of the river, as the two topknots are released and
                  float down the river. The camera zooms out to where Zuko and Iroh stand quietly on
                  the bank of the river.</i></b></p>

            <span class="Other">Iroh:
               </span>	To be honest with you <b><i>[He puts the pot down.]</i></b>, the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.
            <b><i>[Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him.]</i></b> I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by.
            <b><i>[Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something
                  back.]</i></b> But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.

            <span class="Other">Iroh:
               </span>	No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road
            and you surrender to your lowest instincts. <b><i>[Zuko bows his head as he listens to his uncle's wisdom.]</i></b> In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of
            inner strength.
            <b><i>Zuko turns to face his uncle, who looks back at him with a sad look upon his face.

            together. <b><i>[Iroh's brightened expression quickly disappears again.]</i></b> I need to find my own way.
            <b><i>Iroh bows his head in sorrow. Zuko looks at his uncle for a moment before grabbing

            <b><i>The Earth Kingdom soldiers approach him, as does their leader, Gow. Zuko dismounts
                  and takes off his hat, placing it on the ostrich horse. They face each other, battle

               </span>	It doesn't matter who I am. But I know who you are. You're not soldiers; you're bullies.
            Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in
            your army â€“ you're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to
            the war.
            <span class="Other">Gow:
               </span>	<b><i>[To a fellow soldier.]</i></b> Are you gonna let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?
            <b><i>The soldier runs forward, spear in hand. He goes to attack Zuko, who pulls out his
                  sword and punches the other man in the stomach with the hilt without fully unsheathing
                  his sword. Zuko re-sheathes his sword while the man slides backward and runs away,
                  panting heavily in fear.
                  A second Earth Kingdom soldier groans and runs to attack Zuko with his spear this
                  time. Zuko punches the spear upward to move it out of the way, grabs onto the man's
                  forehead, and shoves him to the ground. The man gets up slowly and flees as well.
                  
                  A third Earth Kingdom soldier charges toward Zuko with his spear as well. Zuko stands
                  there, waiting, until the spear is close enough and kicks the spear right in the middle,
                  snapping it. The spearhead, along with half of the spear, goes flying in the other
                  direction. The soldier gasps and runs away from Zuko like the two men before him.
                  Lee laughs in satisfaction. A crowd has gathered; Sela's worried face is one of many.
                  
                  With the last of his cronies gone, Gow steps up to the plate to fight Zuko, dual hammers
                  against dual swords. They draw their weapons, and Gow throws the first blow, a rock
                  he has earthbent, and powerfully thrusts over to Zuko. Zuko deflects it readily with
                  his swords. Gow strikes again, this time with three large rocks instead of one. He
                  sends them over in rapid succession to Zuko, who deflects the first two easily. However,
                  the third rock hits him in the stomach and he stumbles backward. This does not dismay
                  him though, so he charges Gow. An old man in the crowd cheers him on.</i></b>
            
            <span class="Other">Old man:
               </span>	Give him a left! A left!

            <span class="Other">Old man:
               </span>	He's got a left sword, don't he?
            <b><i>Gow does the same earthbending trick as earlier; he throws three large rocks at Zuko.
                  Zuko responds the same as before, deflecting the first two but the third one hitting
                  him square in the abdomen. However, this time, he falls over and somersaults backward,
                  and manages to get up, although weakened and still stumbling around. Gow smiles.</i></b>
            <span class="Other">Old man:
               </span>	Look out!
            <span class="Other">Lee:
               </span>	Behind you!
            <b><i>Gow earthbends again, but with increasingly larger rocks each time. He shoots four
                  rocks at Zuko, who manages to destroy each, one by one. It continues this way, Gow
                  no longer giving little recovery breaks to Zuko. Both are fighting at full force,
                  although Zuko is so busy being defensive of the large flying rocks that he cannot
                  become offensive to Gow. However, finally Gow creates a rockalanche and directs it
                  at Zuko. The crowd gasps collectively. Zuko is sent flying and lands straight on his
                  back, and has a sudden flashback.
                  In the flashback, Zuko is sleeping in his room at night when a hand gently touches
                  his shoulder. He awakens drowsily to see his mother dressed in a cloak.</i></b>
            
            Young Zuko	... Mom?
            <span class="Other">Ursa:
               </span>	Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you.
            <b><i>She pulls the barely conscious Zuko into a hug.</i></b>
            <span class="Other">Ursa:
               </span>	Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you
            are.
            <b><i>She turns away from him with a sad smile, pulls her hood up and disappears down the
                  dark hallway; it is the flashback Zuko had at the very beginning of the episode.
                  The flashback ends as suddenly as it begin, and we cut back to Zuko in the Earth Kingdom
                  village, lying on the ground. Gow is approaching him.</i></b>
            
            <span class="Other">Lee:
               </span>	<b><i>[Whispers worriedly.]</i></b> Get up ...!
            <b><i>Gow raises his hammers to deliver the final blow when Zuko's eyes open. He reaches
                  for his swords and gets up firebending, creating a hurricane of flame. Gow drops his
                  hammers and is pushed over, and lands on his back. Zuko stands there, seething at
                  Gow. Although unarmed, Gow stands up and raises his fists, determined to finish the
                  fight. Zuko charges him, sending various fire blasts. Gow tries to deflect them with
                  earthbending, but the blasts are too powerful and he is sent backward again. Rocks
                  hit his head as he lands in with a cloud of dust.</i></b>
            <span class="Other">Gow:

            <b><i>Zuko kneels down toward Gow, who shudders in fear. However, Zuko does nothing to harm
                  him; he only takes Lee's dagger back. Zuko walks toward Lee to give it back, but Sela
                  (who had been untying Lee) intervenes.</i></b>
            <span class="Other">Sela:

            Young Zuko	Mom? <b><i>[Zuko leaps out of bed and runs out of his room down the hallway.]</i></b> Mom? Mom!
            <b><i>Zuko enters a pillared room, where Azula is admiring Zuko's dagger from behind a pillar.
                  She re-sheathes it and steps out to face Zuko.</i></b>
            Young Zuko	Where's Mom?
            <span class="Other">Young Azula:

            Young Zuko	Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now. <b><i>[Zuko tries to grab it, but misses as Azula quickly moves out of the way, and loudly
                  grunts.]</i></b>

            <b><i>Zuko dashes forward and grabs his knife from Azula, who was dangling in a tantalizing
                  manner. He runs away to keep looking. Zuko reaches the garden where his father is

            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	It's okay. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince,
            cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if

         <p>
            <b><i>An intense shot of blue fire attacks them from behind. Aang stops it using earthbending,
                  but the impact forces him backward a few steps. The camera zooms back toward Azula,
                  the source of the blast, with smoke trailing from her fingertips. Katara uses waterbending
                  to stop another attack, then sends a wave crashing toward Azula, who vaporizes the
                  water with firebending. The mist from the vaporized water allows Azula to jump onto
                  a crystal and firebend two blasts of blue fire. Together, Aang and Katara use waterbending
                  to stop the blasts. Azula finishes her jump by landing on a rock pillar. Aang uses
                  earthbending on the pillar, and Azula gasps once she notices the pillar crumbling.
                  She jumps off and lands between Katara and Aang. She points at both of them, preparing
                  to attack or defend herself.</i></b>
            <b><i>An orange fire blast lands in the middle of the standoff, and they look to see the
                  source of the fire blast to be Zuko. Zuko looks from Azula to Katara and Aang, choosing
                  who to attack. When he looks at Azula, she is glaring back at him. He then looks at
                  Aang, who gasps once he realizes Zuko will attack him. Zuko firebends at him, and
                  Aang uses airbending to jump away from the blast. Azula smiles at this and starts
                  dueling with Katara, and Zuko furiously throws multiple fire blasts at Aang.</i></b>
            
            <b><i>Aang airbends the air currents around him to make a human-shaped gust of air at Zuko,
                  knocking him down. Aang attacks Zuko with more airbending, but Zuko maneuvers around
                  the attacks and gets back up on his feet. He fires more blasts at Aang who is clinging
                  on to a rock pillar. Aang jumps onto a clump of crystals to avoid the attack. Furious,
                  Zuko summons a greater blast of fire. Aang earthbends some crystals to protect him,
                  but the crystals shatter, sending Aang flying to another clump of crystals. Zuko uses
                  fire whips to attack Aang once again, but Aang jumps to another patch of crystals
                  and Zuko keeps attacking.</i></b>
            <b><i>Cut to Azula landing on a puddle of water running toward Katara, who sends a aharp
                  wave of water at Azula that very nearly hits her face, but cuts her hair instead,
                  startling her. Cut back to Zuko, who is still using his fire whips to attack Aang,
                  who is now jumping along the cave's ceiling. Aang kicks down a stalactite and follows
                  it, using earthbending to increase its impact and sending Zuko flying, bouncing off
                  the ground into a small wall of crystals. The scene focuses on Azula and Katara. Katara
                  waterbends at Azula, knocking her down. Azula slowly gets back up into a fighting
                  stance as Katara encases herself in water. One water tentacle captures Azula's hand
                  as she struggles to attack her, and another one captures her foot after another failed
                  attack. Katara then lifts Azula up, who yells in fear. Zuko frees his sister using
                  firebending to break the tentacles. Azula gets up and briefly smiles at Zuko in gratitude,
                  then looks toward the crater Aang had created with the stalactite. Aang crawls out,
                  exhausted. Azula runs toward Aang. Cut to Zuko and Katara fighting. Katara still has
                  water whips on her hands and Zuko starts using his fire whips.</i></b>

            <b><i>The scene changes back to Zuko and Azula both fighting Katara. Hopelessly outnumbered,
                  Katara gets knocked down. Aang jumps from the old building and earth surfs toward
                  Zuko and Azula to stop them from attacking Katara, with a fiercely determined look
                  on his face. However, a Dai Li agent appears and jumps in front of Aang's surf, sending
                  him flying off. Aang yells as he falls. More Dai Li agents gather behind Zuko and
                  Azula. Katara starts regaining her focus and Dai Li agents surround her. Katara uses
                  the octopus form to defend herself. Aang stands up in a fighting stance, but his determined
                  face quickly turns into one of despair.</i></b>

               </span>	I'm sorry, Katara.
            <b><i>Closing his eyes, he turns away from Azula and Zuko and earthbends a crystal shelter
                  tent. Aang starts meditating. Inside Aang's mind, a giant version of himself in the
                  Avatar State, the Avatar Spirit, holds an airbending sphere with a normal-sized version
                  of himself in the Avatar State. Back in the crystal shelter, Aang enters the Avatar State and the crystal shelter starts glowing, alerting those outside. Inside the
                  shelter, Aang opens his glowing eyes and breaks the crystal above him. The camera
                  shows Katara looking up to Aang, now rising in to the air, with hope. But before Aang
                  can let Katara go and control the Avatar State, a bolt of lightning strikes him in
                  the back. Cut to Azula's eyeball watching Aang getting struck, before it zooms out
                  to show her smiling menacingly in a lightning summoning position with her fingers
                  smoking. The Avatar Spirit lets go of Aang and falls out of the plane of existence. As Aang falls down,
                  Katara, tears now falling down her face, creates a wave to catch Aang. The wave knocks
                  down the Dai Li agents and Zuko. She looks down at Aang's lifeless body and back up
                  with tears in her eyes. Zuko and Azula prepare to attack Katara, but a blast of fire
                  stops them. Iroh, the source of the blast, jumps down from the wall of the cave and
                  shields Aang and Katara from Zuko and Azula.</i></b>
            <span class="Other">Iroh:

            <b><i>Katara walks away slowly with Aang's body to a waterfall, and she uses waterbending
                  to lift herself and Aang's body up its path. Iroh holds off the Dai Li agents, taking
                  blows of earthbending, until after Aang and Katara leave. He submits to the Dai Li,
                  who use earthbending to encase him in crystals. Azula is triumphantly smirking next
                  to Zuko, both looking at Iroh. Iroh is looking back at Zuko, then closes his eyes
                  and turns away. Cut to Bosco, Kuei, Toph, Sokka, Aang, and Katara riding on Appa.
                  Appa moans sadly. Cut to a closer shot of Katara placing Aang's body on Appa. Katara
                  opens the vial around her neck and uses water healing on Aang's wounded back. The
                  rest of Team Avatar, Kuei, and Bosco all look sadly and in anticipation. The glowing from the spirit
                  water stops, and Katara starts crying, assuming that it was not enough to save Aang.
                  Aang's tattoos glow for a second and Aang groans. Katara, overcome with joy that Aang
                  is alive, looks at him, who smiles a little, and she holds him closer. Cut to the
