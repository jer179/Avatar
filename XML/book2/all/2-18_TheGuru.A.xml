                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>This is the last chakra, isn't it?</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>Smiles with determination.</sd> Let's do this.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. <sd>Images of Katara appear before Aang.</sd> Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>Coming out of his meditation.</sd> What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her!</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? <sd>Aang throws his hands up.</sd> How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing!</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>You must learn to let go. <sd>Aang contemplates worriedly.</sd></sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Okay, I'll try.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow.</sp>
                <sd>Aang sees an image of him letting Katara go, and a bridge that will lead him to Avatar State mastery. His image looks down, smiles at the bridge, and walks up to the Avatar Spirit, which is an enlarged image of himself in the Avatar State. The Avatar Spirit is holding a ball of energy, and Aang walks directly inside of it. As he does so, his tatooes glow, and he closes his eyes. Right before he is able to completely open the final chakra and master the Avatar State, however, he hears a shriek from Katara and sees a vision of her in chains. At this, he jumps out of the energy sphere and runs away from the Avatar Spirit. The energy bridge that lead him there slowly vanishes behind him until it catches up and falls from underneath him, causing his image to plummet toward Earth. This cuts his connection to the Avatar State, which forces him back to reality.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Katara's in danger! I have to go! <sd>Prepares to exit.</sd></sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Pathik">Pathik</spkr>No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!</sp>
                <sd>Aang hesitates but leaves anyway, leaving Pathik concerned and disappointed.</sd>
