                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>I think so ...</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Then, what are we going to do?</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>What can we do?</sp>
                <sd>She silently walks over and grabs hold of his hand. Aang smiles up at her. The camera cuts to a close-up of Katara's face. The two are seen leaning into one another as the last of the torch light fades. Suddenly, the ceiling of the cave lights up revealing thousands of glowing crystals gleaming overhead.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>That's how the two lovers found each other. <sd>Gestures with her hand along the ceiling.</sd> They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. <sd>Sees the exit.</sd> That must be the way out! <sd>The two hug.</sd></sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>So, uh ...</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>Let's go!</sp>
                <sd>She runs toward the exit. Aang stares after her before shaking his head and smiling. He and Appa follow close behind. They make their way out of the cave and into the outdoors. Appa bounds out of the tunnel and flops onto his back, tongue lolling out in content.</sd>
