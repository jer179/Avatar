                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ... <sd>Sokka enters.</sd> ... three, push!</sp>
                <sd>Ying groans; Sokka passes out. Moments later, the baby arrives and begins to cry. Aang, Toph, and Sokka are all outside the tent.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr><sd>From inside the tent.</sd> It's a girl!</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>So, you want to go see the baby, or are you going to faint like an old lady again?</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>No, no, I'm good this time. <sd>Toph and Sokka enter the tent.</sd></sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>Aang, you have to come see this.</sp>
                <sd>Aang enters to see the new life.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>She sounds healthy.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>She's beautiful.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>It's so ... squishy looking.</sp>
                <sd>Aang begins to smile.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Than">Than</spkr>What should we name her?</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Ying">Ying</spkr>I want our daughter's name to be unique. I want it to mean something.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>Sheds some tears.</sd> I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Ying">Ying</spkr>I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Than">Than</spkr>That's a perfect name. Hope.</sp>
                <sd>Outside the tent. Aang meets with Katara. Suki, Sokka, and Toph stand next to the tent.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.</sp>
                <sd>Katara sheds some tears. Aang and Katara embrace, Katara's eyes still watering. The other three approach.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>See you in the big city.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>Say hi to that big fuzzball for me. <sd>Punches Aang in the arm.</sd></sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>You'll find him, Aang.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>I know. Thank you, Katara. You ready, Momo?</sp>
                <sd>Aang and Momo fly off. The rest wave goodbye.</sd>
