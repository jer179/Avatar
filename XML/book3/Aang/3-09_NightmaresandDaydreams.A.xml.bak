<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds.</sp>
<sd>Pan right to see Katara, Toph, and Sokka standing nearby, with a flock of sheared koala sheep.</sd>
<sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr><sd>Concerned.</sd> <char ref="Aang">Aang</char> ...</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>No, <char ref="Katara">Katara</char>! There's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me! <sd>He begins to wobble.</sd></sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr>I'm not going to hit you.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>You want me to do it? <sd><char ref="Sokka">Sokka</char> nudges her back.</sd></sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr><sd>Approaching <char ref="Aang">Aang</char>, placing a hand on his shoulder.</sd> Listen to me. You've been training for this since the day we met. <sd>Moves behind him, talking over his shoulder.</sd> I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>You really think so? <sd><char ref="Katara">Katara</char> nods.</sd></sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>We all do. You can do this. You're ready.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>You're the man, Twinkle Toes!</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><char ref="Than">Than</char>ks, guys. <sd>He nods, yawns, and rubs his eyes. <char ref="Katara">Katara</char> aids him to the bed, where he lies down.</sd> You know what? I think I am ready. <sd>The other three watch as he falls asleep quickly. He falls into another dream, meeting with Ozai again.</sd> Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!</sp>
