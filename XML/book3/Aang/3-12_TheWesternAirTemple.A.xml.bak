        <scene n="1">
<sd>As the team runs back to their hiding spot, Combustion Man gears up again, but is dizzy and cannot aim properly. His next shot fails to escape, causing an explosion around him resulting in the building he stands on getting destroyed. Cut to his metal arm as it flies away from the explosion, followed by the falling building. The gang looks on, shocked. Haru, Teo, and The Duke all appear from behind a pillar also shocked.</sd>
<sd>Zuko climbs a plant root, having survived the ordeal. Later, Zuko again approaches the gang.</sd>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>I can't believe I'm sa<char ref="ying">ying</char> this, but ... thanks, <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char>.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Zuko">Zuko</spkr>Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. <sd>To <char ref="Toph">Toph</char>.</sd> I'm sorry for what I did to you. <sd>Bows to her.</sd> It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a moment.</sd> I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned <char ref="Katara">Katara</char>, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. <sd>Bows before <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char>.</sd></sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Zuko">Zuko</spkr><sd>Bows.</sd> Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. <sd>To Toph.</sd> <char ref="Toph">Toph</char>, you're the one that <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> burned. What do you think?</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Toph">Toph</spkr>Go ahead and let him join. <sd>Pounds her fist into her palm jokingly.</sd> It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>Turning to Sokka.</sd> <char ref="Sokka">Sokka</char>?</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr><sd>Shrugging.</sd> Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it.</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>Approaching Katara.</sd> <char ref="Katara">Katara</char>?</sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr><sd>Glares at Zuko for a moment and <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> starts to sweat; reluctantly.</sd> I'll go along with whatever you think is right. <sd><char ref="Aang">Aang</char> smiles.</sd></sp>
<sp><spkr ref="Zuko">Zuko</spkr><sd>Excitedly approaching the group.</sd> I won't let you down! I promise!</sp>
<sd>Aang, Katara, and Sokka exit, the latter carrying Toph. Later, Sokka shows Zuko to his room.</sd>
