 Zuko	speaker	Zuko The Avatar! [He turns slightly, but looks back at the footprints.]	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Uncle ... [Switch to a close-up of Iroh with Zuko on the background.] I thought a lot about what you said.	Iroh	referent

 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Where's Mom?	Ursa	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now. [Zuko tries to grab it, but misses as Azula quickly moves out of the way, and loudly grunts.]	Azula	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Uncle?	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko I know my own destiny, Uncle!	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Stop it, Uncle! I have to do this!	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko It's okay. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar? [Points to Aang.]	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar? [Points to Aang.]	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko [Hurt.] Why, Uncle?	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko I betrayed Uncle.	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?	Ozai	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko [Turning around.] For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero. [Close-up of Azula, who smiles.] Everything should be perfect, right? [Aerial view of campsite.] I should be happy now, but I'm not. [Turning back to the others.] I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!	Ozai	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.	Azula	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived.	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko But I've come to an even more important decision. [Closes eyes and momentarily pauses.] I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. [Puts his swords away.] Goodbye.	Aang	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. [To Toph.] I'm sorry for what I did to you. [Bows to her.] It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.	Ozai	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko [Frontal view.] No, I'm not okay. My uncle hates me, I know it. [Katara sits down next to him.] He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko [Cut to view of Iroh from behind.] Uncle, [Cut to view of Zuko over Iroh's shoulder.] I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me. [Cut briefly to view of Iroh from behind before back to a frontal view of Zuko.] But I want you to know, [Starts to cry.] I am so, so, sorry, Uncle. I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did. I don't know how I can ever make it up to you. But I'll- [He is cut off. Cut to side-view as Iroh pulls him into a hug, while starting to cry as well. Close-up of Iroh who starts to smile. Close-up of Zuko who becomes shocked and confused.] How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me.	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko It wasn't that hard, Uncle. You have a pretty strong scent.	Iroh	referent
 Zuko	speaker	Zuko Please. The real hero is the Avatar. [Aang walks next to Zuko. Crowd cheers again. Aang turns his head slightly. Cut to side-view of Katara. The camera rotates as she smiles up at Aang proudly. Cut to overhead view of Aang and Zuko, their backs to the camera, looking out at the crowd.] Today this war is finally over! [Cut briefly to Haru, Tyro, Mechanist and Teo as the crowd cheers. Cut to front view of Zuko.] I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation. And I will. [Panning front view of Zuko and Aang, as seen from the crowd's perspective.] The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided. [Cut to side shot of Aang, rotating around, as he turns to see Zuko smile at him, before turning back to the crowd.] But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace.

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh [Places his hands on Zuko's shoulders.] Prince Zuko, what's wrong?	Zuko	referent

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. [Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai.] When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. [Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.] Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. [Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear.] Zuko would have to duel his own father.	Zuko	referent

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh [With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism.] Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. [He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.] I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. [He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.] Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?	Zuko	referent

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh Excellent form, Prince Zuko.	Zuko	referent
 Iroh	speaker	Iroh So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask ...	Zuko	referent
 Iroh	speaker	Iroh I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?	Aang	referent
 Iroh	speaker	Iroh [Starts yelling.] And then what!? You never think these things through! [Points at him.] This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go!	Aang	referent
 Iroh	speaker	Iroh I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do you want?	Zuko	referent

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh Zuko! [Rushes to him.]	Zuko	referent

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh Zuko, it's time we talked. [To Aang and Katara.] Go help your other friends. We'll catch up with you. [They walk away, Katara looks back at Zuko, who is looking sadly to the side, before moving on.]	Zuko	referent
 Iroh	speaker	Iroh You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. [Smiles.] You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. [Close-up to Zuko's face.] It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.	Zuko	referent
 Iroh	speaker	Iroh Zuko, I am begging you. [Close-up of Zuko's face as he focuses from Azula back to Iroh.] Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want. [Zuko resumes contemplating.]	Zuko	referent

 Iroh	speaker	Iroh Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. [Zuko sits down, with his head facing down.] Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. [Zuko looks up.] What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.	Zuko	referent
 Jee	speaker	Jee I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident.	Zuko	referent
 Jee	speaker	Jee So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.	Aang	referent

 Aang	speaker	Aang [Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a moment.] I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. [Bows before Zuko.]	Katara	referent
