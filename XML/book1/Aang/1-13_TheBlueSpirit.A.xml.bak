                <sd>The Blue Spirit continues backing away from the fortress. Zhao now looks on from
                    the top of the main gate. Cut to an arrow being strung on a bow by an unseen
                    soldier; cut back to Zhao, who looks to his right as he speaks.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Zhao">Zhao</spkr>Do you have a clear shot?</sp>
                <sd>Cut to a Yuyan Archer, who is silent, but aims.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Zhao">Zhao</spkr>Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire
                    Lord along with the Avatar.</sp>
                <sd>The archer releases his arrow, which the camera follows across the field to its
                    impact point on the Blue Spirits masks. Cut to a side-view of Aang and the Blue
                    Spirit as the masked man collapses backward in slow motion. Aang turns in
                    horror, his eyes glazed. He recovers, turns around and airbends up a huge cloud
                    of dust around him and the Blue Spirit.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Zhao">Zhao</spkr>Quick! Recover the Avatar!</sp>
                <sd>Cut to the main gate opening and a crowd Fire Nation soldiers emerging and
                    running toward the dust cloud. Cut to inside the dust cloud, where Aang removes
                    the Blue Spirit's mask to reveal Zuko. Aang starts back in horror and falls
                    backward on the ground. He jumps up and runs away, but turns to look at Zuko,
                    his eyes huge and full of compassion. He sees the Fire Nation soldiers getting
                    close through the smoke. Still, he hesitates. When the dust clears, however, the
                    soldiers find nothing. Cut back to Zhao, looking insanely angry. A frog hops up
                    onto the railing, croaks, and hops off. Fade to white, followed by a blurry shot
                    of a forest looking straight up into the canopy overhead. It is morning. The
                    screen pans down to Aang sitting on a nearby root, the view is still blurry. He
                    looks forlorn. Cut to Zuko, whose view we were clearly just seeing. He looks a
                    bit dazed still.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr><sd>To Zuko.</sd> You know what the worst part of
                    being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang
                    out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The
                    two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the
                    best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we
                    knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?</sp>
