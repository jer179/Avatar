                <sd>Appa lands. Katara slides off. Close-up of Zuko.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Zuko">Zuko</spkr><sd>Throwing the tied-up Aang aside who yelps.</sd> Here for a rematch?</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Katara">Katara</spkr><sd>Confidently while countering his fire blasts.</sd> Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.</sp>
                <sd>Katara uses waterbending to launch Zuko into the air before plummeting him down to the ground, knocking him out. Close-up shot of Sokka running toward Aang to untie him with Zuko lying unconscious.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>Hey, this is some quality rope!</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble!</sp>
                <sd>Switch to a wide-view of the area with Aang airbending himself atop Appa. Close-up shot of Aang landing on Appa.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>Wait, we can't just leave him here.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr>Sure we can. Let's go.</sp>
                <sp><spkr ref="Aang">Aang</spkr>No, if we leave him he'll die.</sp>
                <sd>Aang airbends himself off Appa and retrieves Zuko, bringing him to Appa.</sd>
                <sp><spkr ref="Sokka">Sokka</spkr><sd>Sarcastically.</sd> Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.</sp>
